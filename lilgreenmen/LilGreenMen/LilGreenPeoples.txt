LIL GREEN MEN

2 ambedextrous lil kids stumble into an armoury where a small war amongst the guards is in progress.
It's all fun and games til' someone gets hurt!

Objective:
Eliminate the other lil' kid

K = knockable(deflectable with punch)

Holdables:
Uzi - Pretty conventional   
Rifle - can knock off weapons
Stun gun - temporarily stuns enemies
Target - summons airstrike on your position so keep moving!
Flamethrower - nasty but be careful or you'll burn yourself
LAW - similar to the infamous bazooka
Throwing knife - damage decreases with range K
Tranquilizer knife - throwing knife but less damage and lots of tranq K
Molotov cocktail - Sets things on fire K
Medikit - heals and repairs broken arms(except if the arm got broken           due to holding an exploding molotov cocktail) 
Grenade - 4 beep timer, count your beeps properly! K
Fire extiguisher - puts out fire

Vehicles:
Hover tank - pitiful tank which can't squash
Flame tank - medium speed, can squash, okay weapon and immune to fire
Armoured car - good at squashing, tough and okay speed
Trike - super fast, cannot squash and blow up very easily

Other stuff:
Oil spills - flammable and slippery
Red guard - he's a guard and he's red
Blue guard - he's a guard and he's blue
Player 1 - greenish lil kid
Player 2 - purplish lil kid

Damage:

Damage can cause your arms to become broken
Your arms might also become broken without damage to your body
example: You get shot in the arm repeatedly with a rifle.

You can also go on fire, the only way to solve this is to use a fire extinguisher or stun gun(the stun shots turn into fire-extinguishing water when it hits fire)

Broken arms caused by holding an exploding molotov cocktail cannot be healed.

Therefore, if you lose both your arms(and therefore cannot hold a medi kit) your only alternative is to run over the opponent with a vehicle or (ha ha)punch him to death. 

Weapon holding:

Players can hold 2 weapons(you're ambidextrous) but guards can only hold one.
